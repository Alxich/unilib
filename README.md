## Introduction

***Unilib - Real-time Blog Project***

Unilib is a dynamic project built with NextJS, Apollo, MongoDB, and GraphQL. It offers real-time interactions without page reloads, providing a seamless user experience. Unique messaging features enable private conversations and group discussions. An admin panel allows content management, from tags to posts. The Tiptap editor streamlines content creation, and responsive design ensures adaptability across devices. ðŸŒŸ

## Project Status

While Unilib is operational and functional, it's important to note that it's an ongoing project. As such, you might encounter some areas that need refining or unimplemented ideas. The project is currently at the "early_release" stage.

Feel free to explore the codebase. I've added comments throughout the code for your understanding. While ChatGPT assisted with some comments, they still provide valuable insights.

Unilib is suitable for both students working on web programming labs and those exploring some junior lever projects. I've put significant effort into ensuring basic features run smoothly, and I hope you find it useful.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**: `git clone https://github.com/author-username/unilib.git`
2. **Frontend Setup**:
	- Navigate to the Frontend directory: `cd ./frontend`
	- Install dependencies: `npm install`
	- Rename `.env.example` to `.env.local`
	- Provide necessary data in `.env.local`:
	  - `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`: Generate using [openssl](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/options#secret)
	  - Google API credentials: [Link with creating and guide](https://developers.google.com/identity/oauth2/web/guides/get-google-api-clientid)
	  - `MONGODB_URI`: Access URL for your MongoDB cluster
3. **Backend Setup**:
	- Navigate to the Backend directory: `cd ./backend`
	- Install dependencies: `npm install`
	- Rename `.env.example` to `.env`
	- Provide necessary data in `.env`:
	  - `MONGODB_URI`: Access URL for your MongoDB cluster (same as frontend)
4. **Run the Project**:
	- Start frontend: `cd ./frontend && npm run dev`
	- Start backend: `cd ./backend && npm run dev`
